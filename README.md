hello-world
===========

Hi, I am Mark. I am learning how to do this so I can be one with everything.
I also like space tacos that consist of meteor bites.

Also, I need to create or link this directory to my local git account by doing the following:

-Open Git Bash (on a mac), need to figure out how to do this again.
-Create a directory on my computer where I will store the copy of repo:
$mkdir ~/test-repo
-Navigate to this new directory using:
$ cd ~/test-repo
-Initialize a local Git repository in this directory
$ git init
-Point your local repository at the remote repository you just created on the GitHub server
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/kiloj757/test-repo.git

===FORKING===
After forking a repo on GitHub
You have a copy on your GitHub acount and NEED to make a local copy of the repo on my computer
This is called "cloning" and can be done using the following command:
$ git clone https://github.com/kiloj757/repoNameHere.git
NOTE: This will clone the repository into your current directory.
